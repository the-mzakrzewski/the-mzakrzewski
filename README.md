# 👋 Hey, I’m Michal Zakrzewski

I’m a **backend developer** with **13 years of experience** building **fast, scalable APIs** and **web applications** that power businesses. I love crafting **clean, maintainable code** with tools like **Laravel**, **Python**, **Docker**, and **Redis**, delivering apps that **run smoothly** and **save server costs**.

## What I Do
- 🛠️ **APIs & Backends**: Build high-performance REST APIs and web backends for mobile apps, SaaS, or e-commerce, using Laravel, Python, or Node.js.
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization**: Make apps fly by cutting latency and server costs, with Redis and AI-driven insights.
- 🤝 **Consulting**: Guide teams on tech stacks and architecture, keeping it pragmatic—no trendy tools unless they deliver.
- 💡 **AI-Driven Workflows**: Use AI as my coding sidekick to boost quality and solve tough problems faster.

## Why Work With Me?
- **Curiosity**: I dive deep into problems, learning new tech to keep your project future-proof.
- **Quality**: My code is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain, saving you time and headaches.
- **Pragmatism**: I pick tools like Docker or MongoDB for results, not hype (no React overkill here!).
- **Results**: Clients love my work—like cutting server costs by 20% or simplifying app updates.
